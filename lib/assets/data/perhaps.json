// Perhaps
// http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cake/perhaps.html

// You won't admit you love me.
// And so how am I ever to know?
// You only tell me
// Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
// A million times I ask you,
// And then I ask you over again.
// You only answer
// Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.

// If you can't make your mind up,
// We'll never get started.
// And I don't wanna wind up
// Being parted, broken-hearted.
// So if you really love me,
// Say yes.
// But if you don't, dear, confess.
// And please don't tell me
// Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.

// Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps,
